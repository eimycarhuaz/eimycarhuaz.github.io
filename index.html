        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Peruvian aspiring filmmaker based in NJ and NY, pursuing a degree in Film & Television and Arts Administration with a minor in Film and Media Studies. Through my job at Breakout Sport Broadcasting, I strengthen my camera and communication skills while working as a videographer, photographer, and camera operator. My internship at Trenton Film Society allows me to apply what I’ve learned in Arts and Entertainment Industries Management, especially in legal aspects, marketing, and content creation for platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I’ve participated in various productions at Rider University and with fellow creatives, including music videos, narrative films, documentaries, and promotional videos. I aspire to become a director, cinematographer, and filmmaker who tells meaningful stories to the world.</p>
