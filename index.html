                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Peruvian aspiring filmmaker based in NJ and NY, pursuing a degree in Film & Television and Arts Administration with a minor in Film and Media Studies. Through my job at Breakout Sport Broadcasting, I strengthen my camera and communication skills while working as a videographer, photographer, and camera operator. My internship at Trenton Film Society allows me to apply what I've learned in Arts and Entertainment Industries Management, especially in legal aspects, marketing, and content creation for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok.</p>
                <p>It has also helped me gain more knowledge in graphic design and marketing strategies to attract audiences and promote events with flyers, announcements, and more. In addition to my professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work on several student film sets, music videos, narrative films, documentaries, and promotional content. I aspire to be a director, cinematographer, and filmmaker who tells meaningful stories to the world.</p>
